  - A full-stack application with Ruby (backend), Vue.js (frontend), and MongoDB (database).
  - Focus on CRUD operations, data flow between frontend and backend.
- **Resources:**
  - Comprehensive tutorials on full-stack development.
  - GitHub repositories of similar stack projects for reference.

### Continuous Learning

- Engage with online communities (Stack Overflow, GitHub, Reddit).
- Contribute to open-source projects to gain practical experience.
- Stay updated with the latest trends and updates in these technologies.

### Tips

- **Practice Regularly:** Hands-on practice is crucial.
- **Build Projects:** Apply what you learn by building projects.
- **Seek Feedback:** Share your code with others for feedback.
- **Stay Patient and Consistent:** Learning programming is a marathon, not a sprint.

This plan is flexible and can be adjusted based on your pace of learning and the time you can dedicate. Remember, the key to success in programming is consistent practice and real-world application of your skills.
